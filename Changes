Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Latex.

0.8   Thu Aug 17 00:32:36 2000
        - Changed handler routine paramater order and got rid of
	$content_ref.
	- Ported the conversion of images to ImageMagick
	- Changed all calls to $html_element->content to
	$html_element->content_list to deal with undef's (requires
	HTML::Tree .68).
	- Changed get_uri and store_uri a lot.
	- Improved the information printed by &texify when using
	$option{debug}.
	- Tried to improve <PRE> and <CODE> behavior.  I don't know what
	to make it do.  It's sort of difficult.
	- Fixed the <LI> bug.
	- Added an HTML-style paragraph option (no indent and 1 line
	paragraph spacing).
	- Altered default behavior of \[sub]section to \[sub]section-.
	- Changed call to texify from array of parents to single parent
	(more efficient and also can check try attributes).
	- Added the ban_tag option.
	- Fixed "^" bug.
	- Made relative local IMG sources work correcly.  At least, I
	hope.  All this local/network absolute/relative crap is getting on
	my nerves.  It never seems to work correctly.
